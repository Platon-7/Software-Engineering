# Software Engineering

This course is from the 3rd year of my studies. The course had a big project separated in four checkpoints. The topic of the project was to create an application using
Java and Android. Our project was about an app that helps the students of the university to find a partner in team projects. For example if someone for any reason did
not have any friends in a course's classroom, they could use the app and see teams that were looking for another person or just people looking for a team. There were many ideas like 
ratings showing how satisfied your teammates were from your contribution and many others. In general we were very happy with the outcome.
